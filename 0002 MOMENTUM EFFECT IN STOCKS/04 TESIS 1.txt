### Equity Investment Styles

two distinct types of momentum strategies: momentum in returns and earnings momentum.

Traditional return momentum investing suggests that recent trends in returns will be maintained in the future. Thus, momentum investment is a bet that “favor” stocks (which have yielded high returns prior to portfolio formation) will continue to outperform the market. The usual reasoning behind such a strategy is that the performance of stocks and to some extent markets is largely driven by market sentiment.
